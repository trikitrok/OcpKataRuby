# OCP kata.

[Matteo Vaccari](http://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/)'s [Open-Closed kata](http://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/archives/293).

You have to follow this set of rules:

1. Write a failing test.

2. Write a setup that builds an object that makes the test pass.

3. Write next failing test.

4. Can you make it pass by changing the setup and/or creating a new class 
<br>and nothing else? 

    - Yes: Great! Go back to step 3.

    - No: Refactor until you can!
